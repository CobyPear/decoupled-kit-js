Pantheon Front-End Sites is the easiest way to run Decoupled Kit Backend and Frontend Starters.


The Decoupled Kit is built as open source software by Pantheon and the kits can be used anywhere; however, they are built with first-class support for Pantheon and are ready to be used out of the box with Front-End Sites.
