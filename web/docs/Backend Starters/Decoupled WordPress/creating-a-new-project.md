If you are deploying to pantheon, you may also choose one of the following
options:

- Create from Decoupled WordPress Composer Managed upstream:

  - Via the Pantheon Dashboard at this link:

    - [Decoupled WordPress Composer Managed](https://dashboard.pantheon.io/sites/create?upstream_id=c9f5e5c0-248f-4205-b63a-d2729572dd1f)

  - Or Alternatively via Terminus:

    ```bash
    terminus site:create my-new-site "Describe Site" --org='My Team Name' c9f5e5c0-248f-4205-b63a-d2729572dd1f
    ```

  :::note

  - Replace `'{My Team Name}'` with your team name - for example `My Agency`.
    This can also be omitted.
  - `c9f5e5c0-248f-4205-b63a-d2729572dd1f` is upstream_id for Decoupled
    WordPress Composer Managed.
