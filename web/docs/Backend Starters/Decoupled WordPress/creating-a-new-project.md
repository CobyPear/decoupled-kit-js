```

:::pantheon

The following options are available when using the
[Pantheon Platform](https://pantheon.io):

:::

If you are deploying to pantheon, you may also choose one of the following
options:

- Create from Decoupled WordPress Composer Managed upstream:

  - Via the Pantheon Dashboard at this link:

    - [Decoupled WordPress Composer Managed](https://dashboard.pantheon.io/sites/create?upstream_id=c9f5e5c0-248f-4205-b63a-d2729572dd1f)

  - Or Alternatively via Terminus:

    ```bash
    terminus site:create my-new-site "Describe Site" --org='My Team Name' c9f5e5c0-248f-4205-b63a-d2729572dd1f
    ```

  :::note

  - Replace `'{My Team Name}'` with your team name - for example `My Agency`.
    This can also be omitted.
  - `c9f5e5c0-248f-4205-b63a-d2729572dd1f` is upstream_id for Decoupled
    WordPress Composer Managed.

- In the preview site list, select the **Regenerate Variables** action next to
  your new preview site. Proceed through this modal and copy the generated
  application password.
- All other environment variables needed to configure your Front-End Site can be
  accessed via the **Environment Variables** action in the preview site table.

See your starters related **Setting Environment Variables** documentation for
more information on how to set these variables in your local development
environment or on the Pantheon Dashboard.
