```

### Development Notes

- the `rk` prefix is used for tailwindcss and daisyui classes
- New components should be added to the `src/components` directory. Ensure new
  components are also added to the `react-kit` options in the
  `web/generateTypeDocOptions.js` file so that all components have their own
  page in the API reference.
